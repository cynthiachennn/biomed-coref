the mouse striatum : Complex trait analysis of the mouse striatum: independent QTLs modulate volume and neuron number  
The striatum : Abstract  Background  The striatum plays a pivotal role in modulating motor activity and higher cognitive function.
the mouse striatum : Conclusion  We have discovered remarkable numerical and volumetric variation in the mouse striatum, and we have been able to map two QTLs that modulate independent anatomic parameters.
the striatum : Approximately 90% of all neurons in the striatum - 1.5 to 2.5 million in mice [1,2] and 110-200 million in humans [3,4] - belong to an unusual type 'of inhibitory projection cell referred to as medium spiny neurons [5-8].

We : We analyzed variation in striatal volume and neuron number in mice and initiated a complex trait analysis to discover polymorphic genes that modulate the structure of the basal ganglia.
We : We mapped two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with selective effects on striatal architecture.

we : Conclusion  We have discovered remarkable numerical and volumetric variation in the mouse striatum, and we have been able to map two QTLs that modulate independent anatomic parameters.
we : In this study we use a forward genetic approach [21, 22] to begin to map and characterize members of the subset of normally polymorphic genes that specifically modulate the production and survival of striatal neurons.
Our : Our analysis of the neurogenetic control of striatal cell populations relies on the combination of two complementary quantitative approaches.
We :  We report here both neuroanatomic and genetic quantitative evidence that the size of the striatum and the number of neurons contained within it are modulated independently.
Our : Our comparisons are based on five strains, and one consequence of this modest sample size is that sampling errors and intraclass correlations may bias the results [31].
We : We therefore also analyzed a larger sample of genetically heterogeneous ABF2 intercross animals (an F2 intercross between A/J and BXD5).
We : We first determined that the distribution of all four dependent measures were normally distributed (Fig 2), before subjecting the data to correlational analysis.
We : We estimate a single B allele inherited from the BXD5 parent increases striatal volume by approximately 2.0-2.5 mm3.
we : Nonetheless, until we know more about the scope of effects, we have opted to give this Chr 10 locus a generic name, Brain size control 10a (Bsc10a).
We : We identified a second strong candidate interval on distal Chr 19 that may modulate striatal neuron number.
our : The LRS peaks at 15.0 (a LOD of 3.26) at one of our more distal markers (D19Mit123, 51 cM, p = .00055).
we : In mapping neuron number we actually used the residual cell population as a trait, and we are therefore confident that this interval has a selective, although not necessarily exclusive, effect on numbers of neurons in striatum (Fig 4B).
we : In mapping neuron number we actually used the residual cell population as a trait, and we are therefore confident that this interval has a selective, although not necessarily exclusive, effect on numbers of neurons in striatum (Fig 4B).
we : Given these findings we have given the distal chromosome 19 interval the name Striatal Neuron Number 19a (Stnn19a).
us : This non-predictable variation is of particular interest to us because it is generated in large part by genes that have more intense or even selective effects on the dorsal striatum than other brain regions.
We : We have succeeded in mapping one QTL with somewhat more intense effects on the volume of the striatum than the rest of the brain to the proximal half of chromosome 10.
We : We have also mapped a QTL with selective effects on number of neurons in the striatum to the distal end of chromosome 19.
we :  Based on these findings, we anticipated significant differences in the striatum of inbred strains.
We : We did find large strain differences in volume.
our : What was surprising was that in our set of five highly divergent strains the differences in volume were not matched by significant differences in neuron number.
we : It could also be that measuring specific neuronal subtypes would demonstrate a greater amount of variance than we currently report [32].
we : Given the relatively small number of strains that we have sampled, our hypothesis of lower variation in striatal cell populations requires a more extensive test, a problem which we are now pursuing using the large numbers of strains in the Mouse Brain Library .

We :  Verification of QTL Results  We have quantified the population of striatal neurons on both sides of the brain in 77 cases total.
we : Nonetheless, we have succeeded in mapping one locus, Bsc10a, which modulates striatal volume with a genome-wide significance of P < 0.05.
We : We have also discovered linkage on Chr 19 to variation in the total number of striatal neurons.
our : These mapping data are concordant with our strain comparison and collectively suggest that there is apparently no significant genetic correlation between striatal volume and neuron number.
our : To confirm and refine our genetic dissection of the striatum we plan to analyze the AXB and BXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains generated by crossing A/J with C57BL/6J.

we : With this literature in mind, we expected that our measures of striatal volume would predict neuron number in this nucleus.
our : With this literature in mind, we expected that our measures of striatal volume would predict neuron number in this nucleus.
we : With the inbred strains, however, we found that strains with small striata (A/J) had virtually the same number of neurons as those with large striata (BALB/cJ).
our : This conclusion is bolstered at the genetic level by our report of two distinct QTLs for these two morphologic phenotypes.
we : Taken together with previous reports [51-53], we speculate that while total neuron number in the cerebrum may relate to total brain weight, the relationship of these two variables is flexible at the regional level.
we : Subjects  Thirty-four of the 78 mice that we analyzed were common inbred strains that were selected to sample a wide range of brain weights, and by expectation, striatal volumes.
we : To map QTLs that modulate variation in CNS size and cell populations we used an F2 intercross between a strain with low brain weight (A/J) and a strain with high brain weight (BXD5).
we : A total of 518 of these ABDF2 progeny were generated, but for this study we selected a subset of 44 cases, of which 36 were fully genotyped (see below).
We : We therefore measured subjects representing the full range of brain weights (see Fig 2A).
We : We studied approximately equal numbers of males and females.
we : Free-floating sections were stained with cresylechtviolett and four series of every tenth section were mounted on slides and coverslipped (see  for further details).  Histologic Phenotypes  Total Brain Volume  To accurately estimate histological shrinkage for each brain in the sample, we determined the volume of the entire brain and took a ratio of this value to the original fixed brain weight.
We : We determined test-retest reliability by having an observer blindly re-measure striatal volume on a subset of 10 brains from the collection.
We :  We assessed reliability of our estimates of neuronal numbers by having an observer blindly re-estimate neuron number in the same 10 brains above.
our :  We assessed reliability of our estimates of neuronal numbers by having an observer blindly re-estimate neuron number in the same 10 brains above.
we : With a modest sample size such as we have been able to examine using unbiased stereological methods, even a QTL responsible for 30 to 50% of the variance.
our : However, one of our goals in this study is to map QTLs with relatively intense effects on the striatum.
we : For this reason we also have corrected all of the parameters used in the mapping analysis for variation in brain weight using linear regression analysis.
We : We have mapped data with and without compensation for variance in brain weight.

two complementary quantitative approaches : Our analysis of the neurogenetic control of striatal cell populations relies on the combination of two complementary quantitative approaches.
these : The first of these, complex trait analysis, is a comparatively new genetic method that makes it possible to map individual loci that underlie polygenic traits [22,23].
These data : A recent report demonstrates a 25% range of granule cell packing density among 35 BXD recombinant inbred lines [41], a finding supporting the notion that packing density varies significantly among mouse strains.  These data suggest that principles that govern the relationship between neuronal volume and neuron-packing density may differ between the striatum and the other CNS regions.

it : From a technical point of view the mouse striatum has several advantages that make it an excellent target for complex trait analysis of the mammalian CNS.
it : First, it is a large, cytoarchitectonically distinct region comprising approximately 5-6% of the volume of the mouse brain.

the dorsal striatum : Second, the dorsal striatum has a comparatively homogenous cellular composition, potentially reducing the number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect striatal neuron number.
the striatum : Finally, recent experiments on the molecular control of telencephalic development have highlighted a number of genes that influence neuron proliferation and differentiation of the striatum and other neighboring forebrain structures [18][26-30].

Chr 19 : No other chromosomal interval has an LRS score remotely as high as distal Chr 19.
distal Chr 19 : Consistent with this hypothesis, the LRS for brain weight on distal Chr 19 is under 1.0, and weights of all three genotypes average 480 ± 5 mg.
Chr 19 : Linkage on Chr 19 is not affected at all by remapping with control for the striatal volume locus on Chr 10.

the variation in both striatal volume and neuron number among inbred strains of mice : Nonetheless, a significant fraction of the variation in both striatal volume and neuron number among inbred strains of mice can not be predicted on the basis of brain weight or volume.
This non-predictable variation : This non-predictable variation is of particular interest to us because it is generated in large part by genes that have more intense or even selective effects on the dorsal striatum than other brain regions.
