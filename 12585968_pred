Brn3c null mutants : Brn3c null mutant mice show long-term, incomplete retention of some afferent inner ear innervation  Abstract  Background  Ears of Brn3c null mutants develop immature hair cells, identifiable only by certain molecular markers, and undergo apoptosis in neonates.
these mutants : We have therefore investigated in these mutants the patterns of innervation and of expression of known neurotrophins.
Brn3c null mice : Conclusion  The limited expression of neurotrophins in the cochlea of Brn3c null mice suffices to support many sensory neurons, particularly in the cochlea, until birth.
the Brn3c mutants : We have investigated in detail the pattern of innervation in the Brn3c mutants, as well as the expression of NT-3 and BDNF.
Brn3c null mutants : Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)  Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 1b) than in control littermates (Fig. 1a), but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age [13,15].
the Brn3c null mutants : It therefore remains unclear what supports the many afferents in the apex of the Brn3c null mutants until 6 months of age or longer, unknown peripheral neurotrophic substances or neurotrophic support provided by the CNS.
these mutants : Other factors, such as GDNF [11,40] need to be investigated in their expression in these mutants and their functional role needs to be assessed, in particular in the cochlear apex.

the mutant cochlea : 1% of myosin VIIa-positive immature hair cells are present in the mutant cochlea, concentrated in the base.
the cochlea : Despite more severe loss of hair cells (1% compared to 20%), the cochlea retains many more sensory neurons (46% compared to 15%) than vestibular epithelia.
3
myosin VIIa-positive : 1% of myosin VIIa-positive immature hair cells are present in the mutant cochlea, concentrated in the base.
MyoVIIa : Even 6 months old mutant mice have some fibers to all vestibular sensory epithelia and many more to the cochlear apex which lacks MyoVIIa positive hair cells.

the cochlea of Brn3c null mice : Conclusion  The limited expression of neurotrophins in the cochlea of Brn3c null mice suffices to support many sensory neurons, particularly in the cochlea, until birth.

some 'immature' hair cells : Close examination has revealed that some 'immature' hair cells form in Brn3c null mutants and express cellular markers such as Myosin VI and VIIa, calretinin and parvalbumin [3].
these immature hair cells of Brn3c null mutants : Furthermore, these immature hair cells of Brn3c null mutants undergo apoptosis in neonates [3].

Brn3c null mutants : Close examination has revealed that some 'immature' hair cells form in Brn3c null mutants and express cellular markers such as Myosin VI and VIIa, calretinin and parvalbumin [3].
Brn3c null mutants : Furthermore, these immature hair cells of Brn3c null mutants undergo apoptosis in neonates [3].
Brn3c null mutants : Other than these preliminary statements, no data exists concerning the detailed pattern of loss of innervation in Brn3c null mutants.  The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development and beyond.
Brn3c null mutants : In fact, the selective loss of vestibular as compared to cochlear sensory neurons (77% versus 29%; [3]) suggests that NT-3 expression may be less downregulated in Brn3c null mutants than BDNF [6,8,9], provided that at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes place.
Brn3c null mutants : The progressive loss of afferent and efferent innervation in Brn3c null mutants shows neither in spatial nor in temporal pattern a resemblance to losses reported in simple BDNF or NT-3 null mutations [6].

NT-3 : Moreover, recent work shows that in embryos NT-3 is primarily expressed in supporting cells, moving only around birth into hair cells [6,7].
NT-3 : In fact, the selective loss of vestibular as compared to cochlear sensory neurons (77% versus 29%; [3]) suggests that NT-3 expression may be less downregulated in Brn3c null mutants than BDNF [6,8,9], provided that at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes place.

We : We have therefore investigated in these mutants the patterns of innervation and of expression of known neurotrophins.
We : We have investigated in detail the pattern of innervation in the Brn3c mutants, as well as the expression of NT-3 and BDNF.
We : We want to evaluate a possible correlation between the topology of sensory neuron loss and absence of a specific neurotrophin or topological loss of hair cells at birth and in older animals.
We : We report here long term retention of cochlear sensory neurons for at least 6 months, in particular in the cochlear apex, in Brn3c null mutant mice.
we : To appreciate the effects of the Brn3c null mutation on the pattern of the inner ear innervation, we first want to present the effects of BDNF and NT-3 null mutations at birth [6,13,14].
Our : Our null hypothesis for this study would be that Brn3c null mice show severe compromised production of these neurotrophins and should therefore show a comparable pattern of nerve fiber loss.
our :  Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al. [3] of only a 29% loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4, our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 2c,2d).
We : In situ hybridization confirms neonatal neurotrophin expression  We processed four ears of P0 and P8 Brn3c null and control littermates for expression of BDNF and NT-3 using the riboprobes previously described [7].
We : We did not analyze neurotrophin expression in 6-month old animals as neurotrophins are downregulated in neonates [20] and no expression can be found even in normal animals [4].
we : In the canal cristae we expected, and found, only a BDNF signal.
we : In the saccule, we directly compared the BDNF (Fig. 8c,8d) and NT-3 signal (Fig. 8e,8f) of the Brn3c null mutant (Fig. 8c,8e) and control littermates (Fig. 8d,8f).
We :  We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice.
our : In agreement with this suggestion, our in situ data show a severe reduction in expression of BDNF (Figs. 8, 9).
Our : Our data agree with this scenario but extend it.
Our : Our data show that at least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and the cochlear nuclei develops even in Brn 3c null mutants (Fig. 6).
we : Those mutants have a much more severely reduced density of innervation in the developing cochlea [6,14] than the reduction we found in Brn3c null mutants at P0.
our : Relevance of our findings to other mutations with hair cell loss  Vahava et al. [12] and Frydman et al.
Our : Our data on Brn3c null mouse mutants nevertheless suggest that the high to low frequency progressive hearing loss in humans may correlate with the unknown factor(s) that mediate apical spiral neuron survival into adulthood.
our : In contrast, our results suggest a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation between P0 and at least 6 months.
10
BDNF : In fact, the selective loss of vestibular as compared to cochlear sensory neurons (77% versus 29%; [3]) suggests that NT-3 expression may be less downregulated in Brn3c null mutants than BDNF [6,8,9], provided that at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes place.
BDNF : We have investigated in detail the pattern of innervation in the Brn3c mutants, as well as the expression of NT-3 and BDNF.
BDNF : To appreciate the effects of the Brn3c null mutation on the pattern of the inner ear innervation, we first want to present the effects of BDNF and NT-3 null mutations at birth [6,13,14].
BDNF : Null mutants of BDNF or its receptor trkB lose all innervation to the semicircular canals and have a reduced innervation to the utricle, saccule and apical turn of the cochlea.
its : Null mutants of BDNF or its receptor trkB lose all innervation to the semicircular canals and have a reduced innervation to the utricle, saccule and apical turn of the cochlea.
BDNF : Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)  Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 1b) than in control littermates (Fig. 1a), but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age [13,15].
BDNF : These data suggest a loss of 80â€“85% of vestibular sensory neurons in BDNF and trkB null mutants [13] and of 77% of vestibular sensory neurons in P4 Brn3c null mutants [3].
BDNF : There is no specific loss of all afferent and efferent innervation to the canal crista (Fig. 2a), a hallmark of both BDNF and trkB null mutations [13,15].
Corti : For example, the spiral capillary is not found underneath the organ of Corti but in the spiral limbus nearby (Fig. 4).
Corti : Note the presence of a spiral capillary (C) under the tunnel of Corti separating the inner and outer hair cells in the P7 wildtype (e).
Corti : In contrast, no such capillary is present underneath the organ of Corti in mutants (f-h) and no tunnel of Corti is found either.
Corti : In contrast, no such capillary is present underneath the organ of Corti in mutants (f-h) and no tunnel of Corti is found either.
P8 : Compared to P8 animals there is a further reduction of fiber density to vestibular sensory epithelia, but fibers can be traced to all sensory epithelia (a,b).
the Brn3c null mutant : The NT-3 signal was more diffuse in both the control and the Brn3c null littermates but showed some slightly above background signal in the area of the sensory epithelium even in the Brn3c null mutant.
BDNF : For example, in BDNF heterozygotic animals there is a small decrease in the number of sensory neurons in the ear [13] but no change in the overall pattern of innervation.
Brn3c : In contrast, Brn3c is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the CNS [22] thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons depends crucially on the periphery.
BDNF : In agreement with this suggestion, our in situ data show a severe reduction in expression of BDNF (Figs. 8, 9).
BDNF : Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair cells [6,7,20], the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited expression of BDNF, as is the case in the canal cristae (Fig. 8).
BDNF : Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair cells [6,7,20], the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited expression of BDNF, as is the case in the canal cristae (Fig. 8).
BDNF : Past research has shown that in BDNF and trkB null mutants this innervation to canal cristae is lost before birth [6,13].
Myo VIIa :  Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.
GDNF [11,40] : Other factors, such as GDNF [11,40] need to be investigated in their expression in these mutants and their functional role needs to be assessed, in particular in the cochlear apex.

This retention of afferents and efferents : This retention of afferents and efferents is unrelated to hair cell differentiation as not even immature hair cells can be detected at early postnatal stages with MyoVII immunocytochemistry in this part of the cochlea.
This retention of apical spiral neurons : This retention of apical spiral neurons is also largely unrelated to neurotrophins which are known to be reduced in their expression in neonatal rodents [4].  Results

quantitative data published previously [3,13 : The reduction in apparent size of the vestibular ganglia is in agreement with quantitative data published previously [3,13].
These data : These data suggest a loss of 80â€“85% of vestibular sensory neurons in BDNF and trkB null mutants [13] and of 77% of vestibular sensory neurons in P4 Brn3c null mutants [3].
16
P4 Brn3c null mutants : These data suggest a loss of 80â€“85% of vestibular sensory neurons in BDNF and trkB null mutants [13] and of 77% of vestibular sensory neurons in P4 Brn3c null mutants [3].
Brn3c null mutants : In newborn animals, the vestibular ganglion shows a dramatic reduction in Brn3c null mutants (b) compared to control littermates (a).
the Brn3c null mutants : However, the Brn3c null mutants show only a reduced density of afferent and efferent fibers to all vestibular sensory epithelia.
both control and Brn3c mutant littermates : The NT-3 expression is much more diffuse in both control and Brn3c mutant littermates.
control littermates : The NT-3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC's persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice (Fig. 9e,9f).  Figure 9  BDNF and NT-3 mRNA expression is shown in the cochlea of P0 (a-d) and P8 (e,f) Brn3c null and control littermates.
17
Brn3c null mutant mice : We report here long term retention of cochlear sensory neurons for at least 6 months, in particular in the cochlear apex, in Brn3c null mutant mice.
Brn3c null mutants : No major differences in pattern of projection through radial fibers are found in the cochlea of Brn3c null mutants (d,f) as compared to control littermates (c).
18
Fig. 2b : Similar patterns of innervation are obtained using acteylated tubulin immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2b).  Figure 2  Innervation of Brn3c null and control ears are shown for newborn mice.
Fig. 2c,2d :  Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al. [3] of only a 29% loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4, our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 2c,2d).
19
P0 Brn3c null mutants :  Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al. [3] of only a 29% loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4, our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 2c,2d).
Brn3c null mutants : No selective loss of spiral neurons is observed in Brn3c null mutants in the basal turn, a feature of either NT-3 or trkC loss [6,9,14].
20
Fig. 1b : Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)  Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 1b) than in control littermates (Fig. 1a), but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age [13,15].
Fig. 2f : Likewise, the innervation of the apex (Fig. 2f) shows no detectable abnormality in overall pattern of innervation compared to control animals (data not shown), an indication that BDNF could be expressed in the apex [6].
Fig. 2e : In addition, the pattern of efferent innervation shows no deviation from normal either (Fig. 2e), whereas they show the same pattern of loss as afferent fibers in neurotrophin null mutants [16].
21
the apex : Likewise, the innervation of the apex (Fig. 2f) shows no detectable abnormality in overall pattern of innervation compared to control animals (data not shown), an indication that BDNF could be expressed in the apex [6].

our data :  Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al. [3] of only a 29% loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4, our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 2c,2d).
These data : These data suggest that the spiral sensory neurons develop qualitatively normal at least until P0 and therefore allow normal pathfinding of efferents.
these tracing data :  In summary, these tracing data suggest that mature hair cells are not necessary to direct fiber outgrowth and to maintain some fibers at least up to 6 months in the apex of the cochlea.
23
Fig. 2c : Afferents reach all three rows of outer hair cells in the basal turn of control wildtype littermates (Fig. 2c), but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 2d) and does not show any clear organization into three distinct longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the three rows in the outer hair cell region.

24
P0 : Brn3c null mutants at P7/8  Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced than at P0.
P0 : In contrast, the innervation to the canal cristae, while reduced, has changed little from P0.
25
The apex : The apex shows less pronounced deviations from normal (Fig. 3f,3g).
the base : However, as in the base, afferents and efferents extend sparingly to the outer hair cell region.
the apex of the cochlea : Not a single immature hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea.
the apex : No MyoVII positive immature hair cells exist in the apex.
26
the habenula perforata : In control animals there is dense innervation of inner hair cells, whereas Brn3c null mutants show a curious aggregation of fibers near focal spots around the habenula perforata.
the habenula perforata : There is formation of an inner spiral bundle communicating both afferents and efferents between the focal points where fibers appear to pass through the habenula perforata (Fig. 3f,3g).
27
The cochlea at P8 : The cochlea at P8 shows more qualitative deviations from the normal pattern of innervation.
the cochlea : Immunocytochemical and histochemcial data show the presence of only a few immature hair cells in the cochlea (Fig. 4), which amounted to about 1% (Table 1).
the cochlea : Not a single immature hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea.
28
more immature hair cells : In contrast, more immature hair cells are found in the appropriate position of hair cells in the vestibular endorgans (Table 1).
these immature hair cells : In fact, the vestibular end organs show no overt morphological defect other than the reduced presence of these immature hair cells.
29
P0 and P8 Brn3c null mutants : Nerve fibers can be traced into the sensory epithelium of P0 and P8 Brn3c null mutants past the habenula perforata and there is a normal location of spiral sensory neurons in Rosenthal's canal in the apex of P8 Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 3d,3g).

The cochlea : The cochlea shows other defects as well.
the cochlea : The lack of immature hair cells seems to affect also the formation of pillar cells (undifferentiated almost throughout the cochlea; Fig. 4) and Deiters' cells (not recognizable based on their morphology), a suggestion consistent with recent molecular data on the interaction of hair cells and supporting cells [17,18].  Figure 4  The distribution of hair cells as identified with MyoVII immunocytochemistry is shown for 7-day old whole mounted cochlea (a-d) and the appearance of cytological differentiation is shown as revealed with epoxy resin sections in 7-day old (e-g) and 6-month old (h) control (a,c,e) and Brn3c mutant cochleae (b,d,f-h).

MyoVIIa : Only a few undifferentiated hair cells were detected by MyoVIIa immunostaining and only in the basal region of the cochlea.
MyoVIIa : And yet only about 50% of cochlear sensory neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the apex in which we could not detect any immature hair cells with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry.

lost : And yet only about 50% of cochlear sensory neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the apex in which we could not detect any immature hair cells with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry.

the apex : This does not exclude the possibility that even less differentiated hair cells may form in the apex.
the apex :  The cochlea, most prominently the apex, receives many afferent fibers, which form an interrupted inner spiral bundle (Fig. 7c).
the apex : Even at this late stage in maturation there are still numerous spiral neurons present in the apex (Fig. 7c,7d).
the apex of the cochlea :  In summary, these tracing data suggest that mature hair cells are not necessary to direct fiber outgrowth and to maintain some fibers at least up to 6 months in the apex of the cochlea.
the apex of Brn3c null mutants : However, the apex of Brn3c null mutants, which retains most of the spiral neuron afferents at 6-month, shows no formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here (P0, P8, P10).
the apex of the Brn3c null mutants : It therefore remains unclear what supports the many afferents in the apex of the Brn3c null mutants until 6 months of age or longer, unknown peripheral neurotrophic substances or neurotrophic support provided by the CNS.
the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa :  Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.
the apex : This does not preclude that even less differentiated hair cell precursors may form in the apex or that those precursors have died before birth.

Vestibular ganglia : Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)  Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 1b) than in control littermates (Fig. 1a), but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age [13,15].

52
only a BDNF signal : In the canal cristae we expected, and found, only a BDNF signal.
This signal : This signal was very strong over hair cells of the P0 control animals (Fig. 8b).
the BDNF signal : In the cochlea, the BDNF signal was very weak in the base in both the control (Fig. 9b) and the Brn3c null littermates (Fig. 9a).
53
BDNF : Canal cristae contain only BDNF (a,b), but gravistatic endorgans, such as saccule and utricle, contain both BDNF and NT-3 (c-f).
BDNF : Note the prominent BDNF expression in the hair cell region (HaC) of control canal (b) and saccule (d) and low levels of expression in the Brn3c null mice (a,c) over immature hair cells (iHC).
54
the Brn3c null mutants : The BDNF signal in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains appeared also in the Brn3c null mutants (data not shown).  Figure 8

the Brn3c null littermates : In the cochlea, the BDNF signal was very weak in the base in both the control (Fig. 9b) and the Brn3c null littermates (Fig. 9a).
Brn3c null littermates : However, there was a surprisingly strong NT-3 signal over the organ of Corti in the apex of Brn3c null littermates (Fig. 9c) that closely matched the signal found in the control littermates (Fig. 9d).
Brn3c null mice : The NT-3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC's persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice (Fig. 9e,9f).  Figure 9  BDNF and NT-3 mRNA expression is shown in the cochlea of P0 (a-d) and P8 (e,f) Brn3c null and control littermates.
Brn3c null mice : NT-3 expression persists at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice in an area that topologically compares to the inner hair cells of control animals (e,f, arrows).
Brn3c null mutants : Probing for the proper expression of supporting cell specific markers in Brn3c null mutants is necessary to further evaluate these suggestions.

57
BDNF : In situ hybridization confirms neonatal neurotrophin expression  We processed four ears of P0 and P8 Brn3c null and control littermates for expression of BDNF and NT-3 using the riboprobes previously described [7].
BDNF : A strong BDNF signal was found over the hair cells of control animals and an occasional immature hair cell also showed a BDNF signal in the Brn3c null mutants.
BDNF : The situation in the utricle, saccule and cochlea is less clear as both BDNF and NT-3 are expressed [6,7].
BDNF and NT-3 : Past work has shown that BDNF and NT-3 appear to shift in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system [6,10,20,23].

these data : We will explore five points in this discussion: How the limited expression of neurotrophins relates to the apparent survival of primary neurons until P8; how the known absence of apical hair cells and of classical neurotrophins can be related to the presence of large numbers of apical turn spiral neurons; how absence of differentiated hair cells affects afferent and efferent targeting; and how these data possibly relate to other mutant animals and to children born with profound hearing loss.

P8 :  Immature hair cells and limited expression of neurotrophins rescue afferent projection until P8  The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the mediators for target mediated cell death.
67
only properly connected sensory neurons : In essence, this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to support only properly connected sensory neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins [21].

this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support : In essence, this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to support only properly connected sensory neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins [21].
this theory : Past experiments, which eliminated one or more neurotrophins entirely, only partially tested the basic assumption of this theory in vivo.

71
suggest :  We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice.
this suggestion : In agreement with this suggestion, our in situ data show a severe reduction in expression of BDNF (Figs. 8, 9).
72
a severe reduction in expression of BDNF (Figs. 8, 9 : In agreement with this suggestion, our in situ data show a severe reduction in expression of BDNF (Figs. 8, 9).
this reduction : Despite this reduction, some, apparently biologically significant low levels of neurotrophins are apparently expressed in all sensory epithelia in embryonic Brn3c null mutants.
This expression of NT-3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates : This expression of NT-3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of 8-day old animals (Figs. 3, 4).  Long term survival of apical sensory neurons is unrelated to differentiated hair cells and likely is independent of neurotrophins  
73
some, apparently biologically significant low levels of neurotrophins : Despite this reduction, some, apparently biologically significant low levels of neurotrophins are apparently expressed in all sensory epithelia in embryonic Brn3c null mutants.
even these low levels of neurotrophins in the vestibular sensory epithelia : It appears that even these low levels of neurotrophins in the vestibular sensory epithelia can sustain normal fiber outgrowth and a limited maintenance until P0.
even these low levels of expression : That even these low levels of expression are significant is clear from the fact that all canal sensory epithelia receive an innervation by both afferents and efferents at birth and later (Figs. 2, 3).
74
differ : In fact, it appears that the levels of NT-3 expression hardly differ from those in control littermates (Figs. 8, 9).
The latter : The latter is particularly obvious in the apex of the cochlea.
75
Brn3c null mutants at birth : Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)  Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants (Fig. 1b) than in control littermates (Fig. 1a), but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age [13,15].
Brn3c null mutants : However, the apex of Brn3c null mutants, which retains most of the spiral neuron afferents at 6-month, shows no formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here (P0, P8, P10).
76
the CNS : However, known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult cochleae [4] and significant amounts of neurotrophin expression appear to develop only in postnatal animals in the CNS [24].
the CNS : Such expression in the CNS could possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of neutrophins in targeted null mutants.
the CNS : It therefore remains unclear what supports the many afferents in the apex of the Brn3c null mutants until 6 months of age or longer, unknown peripheral neurotrophic substances or neurotrophic support provided by the CNS.
77
offset : Such expression in the CNS could possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of neutrophins in targeted null mutants.
This : This would work only in cases in which the loss of primary neurons would not already be completed long before birth as is the case in the ear [6,13].  
78
seems :  Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.
This : This does not preclude that even less differentiated hair cell precursors may form in the apex or that those precursors have died before birth.

80
Corti :  Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa.
Corti : Instead of extending radially through the tunnel of Corti to outer hair cells, afferents appear to stall and extend in longitudinal directions as inner spiral bundles (Figs. 3, 7).
Corti : Images of labeled organs of Corti were then acquired using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and the number of hair cells was scored from acquired images.
81
follow : Previous work has suggested that efferent fibers, derived from facial branchial motoneurons, follow afferents and for that reason reflect in detail all connectional deviations of afferents [16,30-32].

84
These data : These data suggest that a cochleotopic projection develops before onset of hearing.
Our data : Our data show that at least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and the cochlear nuclei develops even in Brn 3c null mutants (Fig. 6).
Those data : Those data are also consistent with the formation of a crude cochleotopic projection in NT-3 null mutants [6,14].
85
NT-3 null mutants [6,14 : Those data are also consistent with the formation of a crude cochleotopic projection in NT-3 null mutants [6,14].

87
the recently available mutant mice : Further work on the recently available mutant mice with specific absence of all hair cells [37], outer hair cells in the base [38] or apex [39] could further help to clarify the role of hair cells in forming and maintaining afferent and efferent innervation in these model mice.

88
a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation between P0 and at least 6 months : In contrast, our results suggest a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation between P0 and at least 6 months.
This late sensory neuron loss : This late sensory neuron loss is likely not related to known neurotrophin signaling which becomes reduced in neonatal wildtype animals.

the cochlear apex :  The long term retention of afferents in the cochlear apex in the absence of any apparent differentiation of hair cells raises hopes for cochlear implants in deaf-born children.
91
Brn3c mice : Breeding and genotyping  Brn3c mice were bred as previously described [22].
The animals : The animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
92
the ears : After appropriate diffusion time of the dye, the ears were dissected and mounted flat for visualization in an epifluorescent microscope.
the ears : After photographing as whole mounts, the ears were embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned to reveal the distribution of fibers inside the sensory epithelia in more detail.  Cochleotopic projection was evaluated by inserting DiI soaked filter strips into the base and DiA soaked filter strips into the apical turn of 2 P0 and 4 P8 Brn3c null mutants and a similar number of wildtype littermates.
93
this study : Our null hypothesis for this study would be that Brn3c null mice show severe compromised production of these neurotrophins and should therefore show a comparable pattern of nerve fiber loss.
